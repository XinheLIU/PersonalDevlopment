## Wealth

what is wealth

- Wealth is an asset that earns you money while you sleep.
- Creating wealth and upholding ethical standards can go hand in hand. If you despise wealth in your heart, wealth will avoid you.
- It is impossible to get rich renting out time. You must have equity (partial ownership of a business) to achieve financial freedom.
- Cultivate iterative thinking. All rewards in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
- Choose business partners who are brilliant, energetic, but more importantly, have integrity.

productize yourself

- The way to accumulate wealth is to "productize yourself".
- The premise of "productizing myself" is: what unique value can I provide?
- "Productizing yourself" is divided into two steps, one is to build products or services, and the other is to achieve scale through sales.
- Build a product or service: Figure out what you can offer to society that it needs but doesn't have, and that providing it comes naturally to you, within your skills and abilities.
- Scale through sales: It is not enough to offer one product or one service, thousands must be offered.

Expertise, Responsibility and Leverage
  
The three elements of income are "expertise", "responsibility" and "leverage".

- "Expertise" refers to knowledge that cannot be acquired through training. If society can train you, society can also train others to replace you.
   - If you want to find the "expertise" that suits you, you can recall what things you can do with little effort.
   -Once you find an area that you naturally enjoy and are good at, you can continue to move in this direction.
   - No one can compare to you in "being yourself".
- Be brave enough to take on "responsibility" in your own name, and the society will reward you according to the size of your "responsibility". There are three types of "responsibility": personal brand, personal platform, and risk-taking.
   - Personal brand: Have the courage to speak out on public platforms, find your own audience, and create a personal brand.
   - Personal Platform: Start a business or buy equity for passive income - even when you're on vacation, the business is helping you make money.
   - Risk-taking: take charge of more challenging work, or open up new projects, and obtain high growth and high returns while taking risks.
- To gain wealth, you must make full use of the "leverage" effect. Commercial leverage comes from labor, capital, and products (code and media) with zero marginal cost of replication.
   - Labor and capital "leverage". The former requires strong management capabilities, while the latter requires a large amount of funds. Neither of them can be easily used by ordinary people.
   - **Copying products (code and media) with zero marginal cost is the most "leverage" within the reach of ordinary people**, and it is a leverage that can be used without permission.
     - You can create software and media that work for you while you sleep. If you can't write code, then publish a book, write a blog, make a video, record a podcast.

Judgment

- As time goes by, "judgment" will become more and more important. A wise and "judgmental" person must first know the long-term consequences of personal actions, and then make correct decisions and act on them.
- "Judgment" comes from experience, but it can be quickly established by learning basic skills. There are several methods:
- One is to have a thorough understanding of basic knowledge, so as to be able to explain things clearly to children in simple terms.
- The second is to learn decision-making skills. We must choose the method that will benefit us the most in the long run, rather than just focusing on immediate gains and losses.
- The third is to discover mental models, which help to call up what you have learned and combine principles with past personal experience.
- The fourth is to learn to love reading, don't take reading as a task, read because you enjoy it.

## Happiness

What is happiness

- "Happiness" is a state that does not require active action. When the "sense of regret" is removed from life, happiness will arise spontaneously.
- The more you live in the moment, the more you will feel happy and satisfied.
- The meaning of "happiness" is mainly to have no pain, no desire, not indulge in thinking about the future or the past, truly embrace the present, embrace the status quo, and embrace everything in reality.
- True "happiness" is just a by-product of inner peace, which mainly comes from accepting reality rather than changing the external environment.
- "Happiness" is a choice, a skill that can be cultivated, not an objective existence, but a subjective feeling.

Living in the moment

- Happiness requires "living in the moment".
- Don't fall in love with the past, don't care about the present, and don't welcome the future: I don't miss the things that have passed;
- I live in the present, and I don't think wildly, and I won't be shaken by the temptations around me; no matter how good things are in the future, I won't expect them, and I won't deliberately flatter them.
- Nothing exists except the present. No one has been able to go back in time, and no one has successfully predicted the future in any meaningful way. The only thing that exists is the here and now, the moment and place in space that you happen to be.
- If you are immersed in planning and fantasizing about the future every day, you are killing your own happiness with your own hands.
- Inspiration is fleeting, but action should be timely. It's as simple as taking action on an idea and being patient with the results.

interpersonal relationship

- If you don't want to work with a person for a lifetime, then don't work with him for a day.
- You can try to answer these questions:
   - Are they all positive and optimistic people?
   - Did it take a lot of effort to maintain a relationship with them?
   - Do I have admiration and respect for them without jealousy?

change habits

- Essentially, the process of living is about replacing bad habits that you inadvertently pick up with good ones that you have carefully cultivated in an effort to become a happier human being.
- Your happiness index is ultimately determined by your habits and the people you spend the most time with.
- When choosing a habit, you need to think clearly: Is this a habit that will increase my long-term happiness?
- "Happiness is important to me" - it's a decision. At this time, you will put happiness at the top of all affairs in life, and you will spend time researching discussions related to happiness.
- This is the step of "changing habits": first, know what you have to do; Reshape until you transform into a new self.
  
be yourself

- The only thing you should do is what you want to do.
- No one can compete with you in "being yourself".
- Your purpose in life is to find the person, cause, project or art that needs you most. In the vast world, there are all living beings, there are always some people and things that will fit you perfectly.
- "Being your truest self." Pretending means putting yourself in stressful relationships and jobs for years, not minutes.
- Don't spend your time trying to please others. Whether other people are happy or not is their problem, not yours. When you are happy, others will be happy too.


love yourself

- My physical health is where everything starts and comes first, followed by my mental and spiritual health.
- As an advanced animal, human beings should follow a lifestyle that conforms to the laws of nature.
- I put my health first, so I will never use "no time" as an excuse for not going to the gym.
- Persistence is the most important thing every day, and persistence in what to do is secondary. For an individual, the best exercise is the one you can do every day.
- As in all things in life, if you are willing to make short-term sacrifices, you will reap long-term benefits.


meditation

- "Meditation" is intermittent fasting of the mind.
- Life Tip: Try "Meditation" while lying in bed. This way, you either go into deep "meditation" or fall asleep. Either way is fine.
- If ideas are gushing out, let them be. I don't fight it, I don't think it further, I don't accept it, I don't reject it. I just sat there with my eyes closed for an hour, doing nothing.
- "Meditation" does not instantly give you superpowers to control your inner state, but it will make you aware of how out of control your mind is.
- "Meditation" is to block the noise of society and listen to your own voice. "Meditation" will "work" only if "meditation" itself is the purpose. Hiking is walking meditation. Journaling is writing meditation. Taking a shower is accidental meditation. Sitting is direct meditation.

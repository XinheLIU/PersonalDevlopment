## Efficient learning

Effective learning generally includes the following elements

1. Set Learning Objectives
    1. Scenarios: Concrete and verifiable tasks to determine learning outcomes
       1. Tell (share) / test / use (language, programming and other skills)
    2. There is a distance
    3. Has a handle
       1. Start and end times
       2. Specific implementation actions
       3. Execution result quantification
       4. Execution Completion (and Rewards)
    4. There are steps
       1. Milestones and progress scoring
       2. Step by step, average force is difficult to persist for a long time
2. Find learning resources
    1. Search
    2. Paid platform, regular courses/textbooks
    3. Mentor
       1. Getting Started: Get to know the best people in the field and the most professional books
       2. Enter the circle: understand what the top talents and frontiers in the field are doing, and what active communities are there
       3. Worshiping Buddha: contact Daniel directly and ask good questions
3. Efficiency Improvement Methodology
    1. Systematic approach to learning (general rules: around goals / test prep)
    2. Reading method
       1. Extensive reading
       2. Speed and Intensive Reading
    3. Memory method
       1. Memory Palace
4. Inspection and application
    1. Output and Notes
    2. [Feynman's Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/)
       1. ![Feymann's Technique](2023-01-28-20-25-14.png)
    3. Practical application

Improve efficiency

- Configure cognitive resources by category - the category of common learning materials (quoted from "How to Read a Book")
   - The entertainment is going downhill, the more you go, the more comfortable you are;
   - The knowledgeable one is a flat slope, which can be driven, but it is a little laborious;
   - The mental improvement category is climbing. It may look tiring, but it will really improve brain power and understanding, and the speed of understanding new ideas will be accelerated-that is, we say, learning ability is enhanced.
     - The best book is a combination of all three, with different functions that can be read at different times. For example, Peter Drucker's "The Bystander", "The Effective Manager", such as "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People", "Poor Dad Rich Dad", such as "Dream of Red Mansions" in literature.
- Reading by level: first-hand knowledge is more valuable than third-hand and fourth-hand knowledge, classics are more valuable than fragmentation, people and circles standing at the source of knowledge are more valuable than knowledge.
   - First-hand information: sources of knowledge (papers and monographs): intensive field reading
   - Secondary information: faithfully recounting primary information (reviews, textbooks, speeches, popular science books)
   - Third-hand information: statements of opinion simplified and extreme for dissemination (best sellers, articles)
   - Four-hand information: emotional expression full of personal experience for various motives


## fast learning

> How to quickly understand a field

Take 20h fast learning as an example

1. Do your preliminary research
    1. Question 1 is very important, but many people tend to skip it directly. This question is: **Do you really want to learn this kind of thing? **
       1. Practical use, exercise thinking, increase knowledge, socialize
    2. How to learn? People > Paid Courses > Free Content. How to find excellent learning materials
       1. Search
       2. Professional learning website/course platform/university website
       3. Mentor (person)
    3. How high is the cost of learning this thing?
2. Extensive reading
3. Model and note organization
    1. Break down the learning process of a complex skill into several relatively simple steps, and don't grab it with eyebrows and beards. In the process of breaking down the steps, use rational thinking.
    2. Correct the concept and the relationship between the models
    3. Form awareness and new questions
4. Ask the teacher for advice
    1. Consult experts/professionals/investigate professional issues
       1. For a new content and new skills, we are laymen. One hour of thinking on our own is not worth two minutes of guidance from the teacher
    2. Ask good questions
    3. For expenses (such as attending classes, etc.)
5. Output
    1. Put in the real work
       1. Practical work is the most effective way to improve skills
    2. Notes: notes = records + logical relations (thinking)
    3. Understand paraphrase - use Feynman's Technique (Feynman's Technique)
       1. Understand - retell - revise - repeat
    4. Migration
       1. Relevance to existing knowledge, scope of application
       2. Scope of non-applicability
       3. Relevance with unknown knowledge, raising new questions

## deep learning

> How to learn more about a field

### Build a knowledge system by reading

(on the basis of a quick understanding of the field)

1. To enter an unfamiliar field, one must first start by reading "orthodox" literature or works.
    1. Mainstream recognized literature, textbooks, MOOC courses
    2. Classic books in this field
    3. The advantage of following the orthodox path is that it is convenient to communicate with professionals. this point is very important
       1. The difference between folk scientists, or folk masters, and professionals does not lie in the majors they have studied in the past, or even whether they work for a research institution or a professional institution, but whether they often communicate with professionals and integrate into the profession circle of professionals, and be recognized by professionals, such as participating in corresponding conferences and activities, having endorsements from professionals, and so on.
2. Authoritative review articles
    1. The so-called review articles basically summarize the achievements of a field in the last ten years.
    2. Review articles generally come from authoritative professional journals in this field
    3. If you are interested in a certain type of knowledge, read about 5 review articles of this type, and you will have a general understanding.
3. Read some interesting monographs/papers.
    1. Most of the academic works published by scholars today are monographs. Since it is a monograph, the scope of topics discussed is generally relatively narrow, and the views will be very clear, even extreme.
    2. Before reading these books, we need to have an understanding of orthodox knowledge, and don't regard unconventionalism as the mainstream opinion.

graded reading

- Browsing books: quickly flip through, understand the core concepts of the structure, and quickly browse in the middle
   - In the process of reading, I made a lot of marks on the places of interest so that I would have time to read carefully in the future. After reading it in this way, I can understand the outline of the book and the content of interest.
   - For the content that is marked and worthy of attention, I often use scissors to cut out useful chapters and save them
- Books to peruse: Books to read after browsing
   - Can read while highlighting the key points. Sometimes I will also index **key content** so that I can find it if I need it in the future.
- Collection books
   - Reference books: You don’t need to read every word, just look up and use them frequently
   - High-quality books: learning from repeated reading (content, writing techniques, ideas, etc.)
- Guaranteed reading volume
   - For any professional to be top-notch, he must have a comprehensive understanding of his field. That is to say, there is both a breadth of knowledge and a deep understanding of certain issues.
   - **I must read all the top magazines in my field every month**. Although most of them are browsed, at least the abstract and conclusion must be read, so as to ensure the objectivity and neutrality of my ideas.
   - The same is true for investing. Only by quickly filtering out those projects that are not worthy of research, can we have time to focus on the projects with the most potential.
- Build a knowledge map through in-depth reading
   - One purpose of in-depth reading is to use its content to construct our entire knowledge system and cognitive framework after reading a book thoroughly. For example, reading textbooks is the purpose.
     - A good learner can sort out the main points of the whole book according to one clue after closing the textbook and eyes. If you can't do this, it means you haven't fully understood. In order to do this, if you encounter something you don't understand, you need to spend time understanding it, and even read some reference books.
   - Another purpose of in-depth reading is to keep the truth from the false.
     - Examine whether each opinion is supported and whether the source of information is credible.
     - For some professional materials, professional understanding is required, and even professionals are required to help interpret, so as not to have a wrong understanding.

### The main points of system learning

1. For a course, find clues to connect knowledge points and facts as a starting point for learning
       1. For example, the cues of technological progress are information and energy
          1. Before the information revolution, more than half of human technological achievements and inventions were related to energy. The premise of the beginning of civilization is that the energy gained by human activities every day should exceed the energy consumed. The use of fire, the invention of clothes, and the invention of flint weapons are all related to it. Several of the most important early human inventions, such as the wheel, sails, metal tools, and agricultural technology, were all about energy. The first and second industrial revolutions also started around new energy. Many important scientific discoveries in history are also related to energy and information. For example, Kepler, Newton and others described several laws of celestial motion, Joule, Kelvin and Carnot’s thermodynamic theory, and Maxwell’s electrical theory are all related to energy. .
             1. In order to reduce the pollution and greenhouse effect caused by the use of fossil energy, Musk wants to invent electric vehicles. Of course, if electric vehicles still use coal to generate electricity, the benefits to the environment will be limited, so he wants to develop solar energy. In order not to waste the electricity generated by the power plant, he promotes household electricity storage equipment. Although many of Musk's projects are far from as successful as he imagined, such as home energy storage equipment, everyone still supports him because his thinking is clear and reasonable, and it is easy for everyone to understand.
          2. After the second industrial revolution, most major inventions were related to information, from the telegraph to today's mobile Internet, genetic technology, and the quantum communication and quantum computing that everyone is looking forward to. The decimal system of ancient mathematics, the binary system of Leibniz later, the periodic law of elements of Mendeleev, the theories of Shannon and Turing, and about 1/3 of modern scientific Nobel Prize-winning achievements, such as Morgan's genetic theory, The double helix structure of DNA, the structure of penicillin, the 3K cosmic background radiation, and the algorithm of CT scanning are all related to information.
       2. Fairbank enjoys a leading position in the research field of Chinese and East Asian history, not because of his specific historical discovery, but because he invented a brand-new method of studying Chinese history, which is from the perspective of political economy **Study Chinese history, and at the same time put every historical event into a large time and space to consider. This is different from the historians of past dynasties in China, and it has also influenced a whole generation of Chinese historians today.
2. Establish a knowledge map of a subject, that is, connect the content of a course with a relational map. In this relational map, some knowledge is a prerequisite, and some is the result of natural deduction.
3. To understand the background and relevance of ** knowledge. **Any knowledge point needs to be understood in a larger environment. Today, many entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs are very eager to learn many new concepts. They watch every speech of Ma Yun, Lei Jun and others, or hold the books of Drucker and Hayek to death. But they ignore where, when and to whom these people speak. Without understanding the background and environment, those knowledge points will be difficult to apply. This is why we emphasize systematic learning.
4. There is a lot of information today. What most people have to do is not to accept more information, but to select and filter information and make good use of the knowledge they have learned. In addition, it is also very important to learn to use Google to find information and videos about knowledge, so that you can use it when you need it. Never use your limited brain capacity to memorize infrequently used information.
5. The purpose of learning should not be to "relieve anxiety", but to solve the problems you really encounter. ** Many people are inexplicably anxious, and then learn some popular new knowledge, and instantly get the cheap pleasure of "Wow, I understand, I understand the new technology", but this pleasure comes and goes quickly, Anxiety has not been eliminated, and even more anxious because I know more. **The purpose of learning should be to solve the problem, and to think deeply in order to solve the problem until the problem is solved. **
6. Systematic learning is inseparable from discussion

### Deliberate Practice

Deliberate Practice Point 1: Task Breakdown

1. Choose a learning method:
    1. One is naturalism. Naturalism is imitation. Learn what you encounter. The learning process can be fragmented, and the accumulation of less can be more, focusing on the accumulation of quantity.
       1. For language, musical instruments, calligraphy, etc., you may have to use naturalistic learning methods to learn them to be effective.
       2. Naturalism focuses on the text itself. What is text? It is what a knowledge or skill looks like on the surface.
    2. One is structuralism. Structuralism pays more attention to structure when learning things, and learns systematically. The purpose after learning is to create.
       1. Economics, medicine, various sciences
       2. Structuralism It focuses on an understanding of human structure and interactive relationship, and it advocates seeking the underlying relationship through superficial phenomena. In other words, what you want to learn is a system that can draw inferences from one instance. What is the purpose of this appeal? to create
2. After you choose the correct learning method, break down the goal and practice repeatedly for the details, don't take care of the overall situation at the beginning.
3. Squeeze out time to carry out fragmented learning with confusion and problems. The final effect must be to link these fragments.
    1. The truth of fragmented learning is that fragmented learning must be based on search
    2. For a period of time, there should always be a topic in your mind. These fragments are not fallen leaves all over the ground, but we can compare it to fragments produced by a broken porcelain. You have to pick up these pieces purposefully, not randomly. Even if fragmented knowledge is leaves, you must first have roots, trunks, and branches. Fragmented learning needs luxuriant branches and leaves, not picking up a few leaves and putting them in the book
    3. There is a fake fragmented learning called collection. If you don't look at it after collecting it, don't touch it, it doesn't belong to you. You have to break the illusion.

## Study Skills

### Learning environment and sense of ritual

- Set feedback and rewards (small steps)
   - Method 1: Create text feedback and write a summary after reading important things. Be careful not to write out of script, write according to the text, and write in your own language.
     - Summary is called summary in English, and there is even a set of procedures and standards that need to be strictly implemented when writing a summary. I have hardly seen anyone talk about this in a Chinese environment. So, I will now give you an overview of two of the most important rules for writing abstracts.
     - Find out the important facts, statements and some opinions in the text, these are the contents that make up your summary. In addition, those statistics, names, quotations, unimportant details, some comparisons or comparisons, and those examples should not appear in your summary
     - Rewrite in your own words, don't copy
   - Method 2: Create voice feedback, record yourself, and keep playing back.
   - Method 3: Create physical feedback and videotape yourself.
- Set the environment field (specific time and place)
- record (diary) weekly oral harvest
- Sharing and community (learning community)
- Establish problem set (Problem Set)
- Establish a weekly operation list (Checklist) and check in
   - Research progress on the topic
   - current target ("wild duck list")
     - Main battlefield
     - Goals and opponents (how to quantify)
     - Strategy (Methodology)
     - Tactic setting and execution (resources)
- Overcome procrastination
   - Before solving procrastination, first recognize two points: first, everyone has the performance of procrastination; second, even people who think or are thought to have procrastination have not been dragged to death.
   - You can set yourself a really serious task, set small goals, break through by doing this, and then form a kind of inertia.
   - At the beginning, it is recommended to learn some skills that can be mastered when you find the feeling, and gradually rise to things with strong skills, and finally things that need to change from quantitative to qualitative.

### Training Concentration

1. Ordinary life itself cannot train people's concentration, but it can be improved by creating a sense of ritual.
2. Concentration can be trained in the following four aspects:
     1. Shopping: If you need tools to learn something, buy expensive ones and make yourself feel bad.
     2. Eating: Learn to eat well by yourself, it is best to be able to cook for yourself seriously.
     3. Work and study: Use spotlights as much as possible to create the feeling of being on the stage.
     4. Sleep: It is recommended to enter high-quality sleep through exercise.
3. Meditation

### Reading method

#### Extensive reading skills

- Read with a purpose
   - Macro issues: main idea, author's attitude
     - Reading table of contents + browsing: master the common article structure (comparative analysis, progressive etc.)
   - Detailed questions: Specific content specific information
     - Around content elements: 6W1H question (Where Who When What Why How Which)
- Note organization method
   - Order (Abstract) and table of contents
   - Annotate models, concepts
   - Two notes/reviews: relationships between concepts

#### Speed Reading

- Adjust the position of the book
   - The effective viewing angle for our reading is only 1 degree, so when reading quickly, don't hold the book too close. Hold the book farther away from the distance you are used to. Developing this habit can increase your reading speed by 30%.
- finger reading
   - After a period of training, it can get faster and faster. You can read as fast as your fingers run. Because it is actually managing your attention, giving your attention a clear direction, and only processing one piece of information at a time. With this kind of intense focus, your speed will be faster and your understanding will be better.
- Multi-environment input
   - Voice assisted reading
   - Audio acceleration can be adapted gradually
   - Listening to the audio and reading the text at the same time is equivalent to entering a message twice at the same time, and it is stimulated by different channels, so the effectiveness is much higher.

#### Intensive Reading Skills

### Professional Journals

- Science Read the famous "Science" magazine. It is the core journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and non-technical people may not be able to read it, but it will regularly publish some reviews, covering various frontier fields of science.
- For medical progress, read the online journal Perspectives of the American Medical Association, which can be subscribed for free online (website: https://nam.edu/, just provide your name and email address), it also Popular review reports will be published on a regular basis. For example, I recently read "Application of Artificial Intelligence in Health Care", which is a nearly 300-page report.
- For engineering, see "Spectrum" magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
- The financial field is more concerned by the public than science and technology and medicine, and there are many very popular and good magazines. I trust "Barron" and "The Economist" more. As for the well-known "Forbes" and Bloomberg's "Business Weekly", in fact, the level is very average, I don't think their content can be used as investment guidance.

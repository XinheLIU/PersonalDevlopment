### Do's and Don'ts

Don'ts

- **Don't surprise your boss.** It's not fun bringing your boss bad news. Worst is your boss learn bad news from someone else.
- **Don't approach your boss only with problems.** You always bring problems with plans on how you proceed. (at least give some thoughts about how to address the problem, even if it's only gathering more information)
- **Don't run down your checklist.** Don't go in without at most three things you wreally need to share or on which you need action.
- **Dont't expect your boss to change. *

Dos

- **Take 100 percent responsibility for making the relationship work.** 
- **Negotiate time lines for diagnosis and action planning.** Don't let yourself get caught up immediately in firefighting or be pressured to make calls before you are ready. 
- **Aim for early wins in areas important to the boss.** Figure out what your boss cares about most. (3 things most important to your boss)
- **Pursue good marks from thoses whose opinions your boss respects.** Including your peers, subordinates, and coworkers in other departments.

## 5. Secure Early Wins

Early wins execite and energize people and build your personal credibility.

### Making waves

- Each wave of change should consist of distinct phases: learning, designing the change, building support, implementing the change, and observing results.
- Goal of first wave of change is to secure early wins. The new leader tailors early initiatives to build personal credibility, establish key relationships, and identify and harvest low-hanging fruits. (the highest potential opportunities for short-term improvenemtns in organizational performance.)
- The second wave typically addresses more fundamental issues of strategy, structure,systems, and skills to reshape the organization : deeper gains in organizational performance are achieved. 

### Starting with the Goal

Early wins must do **double duty**: help you build momentum in the short term and la a foundation for achieving your longer-term business goals. To the greatest extent,

- Focus on business priorities: consistent with your agreed-to goals-what your bosses and key stakeholders expect you to achieve (Timely)
- Identify and Support Behavioral Changes: help you introduce the new patterns of behavior you need to achieve the goals
  - Problematic behaviroal pattersn examples
    - lack of Focus
      - too many/ not clear priorities
      - resources spread to thin, too much firefighting
    - lack of Displine
      - people exhibit great variation in therir level of performance
      - employees don't understand the negative results of inconsistency
      - people make excuses when they don't meet commitments
    - lack of Innovation
      - **use internal benchmarks for success**
      - improvements in products and processes unfold slowly and incrementally
      - Employees are rewared for maintaining stable performance, not for pushing the enevelop
    - lack of Teamwork
      - team members compete with one another and protect turf rather than work together to achieve the goals
      - people are rewared for creating fiefdoms
    - lack of Sense of Urgency
      - team ignore the needs of external and internal customers
      - complacency regins, revealed beliefs such as "We are the best"; "It doesn't matter if we respond immediately; it won't make a difference"

### Adopting Basic Principles

- Focus on a few promising opportunites
- Get wins that matter to your boss.
- Get wins in the right ways.
  - must not be achieved in manner that seens as manipulative, under-handed, or inconsistent with the culture
- Take your STARS portfolio into account.
- Adjust for the culture.
  - some organizations win must be a visible individual accomplishment, in others team glory is rewarded.

### Identify Your Early Wins

  - build your early wins in roughly the first 30 days
  - and deciding which projects you will launch achieve early performance improvements beyond that
- Unstand your reputation
- BUild credibility
  - demanding but able to be satisfied
  - accesible but not too familar
  - decisive but judicious
    - make low-consequence decisions quick and defer important decisions to when you know enough to make the right call
  - focused but flexible
    - zeroing on issues but consulting others and encouraging input
  - active without causing commotion
    - make things happen, create momentum, but aviod pushing people to the limit of burnout
  - willing to make tough calls but hummane

  - **What key message you want to get accross aboutwho you are and what you represent**? Who are the key audience? (direct reports, other employees, key outside consituencies)
  - Think about the modes of enagement, how will you introduce youself
  - identify and act as quicly as you can to remove minor byt persistent irritants. 
  - keep in mind that effective learning build personal credibility, it;s never a bad thing to be seen as genuinely committed to understanding your new organziation.
- Write your own story
  - Look for and leverage teachable moments. (moments that clearly display what you're about) They also model the kinds of behavior you want to encourage.
- Launch early win projects 
  - Identify three or four key areas, you will seek to achieve rapid improvement
  - Translate your goals to projects
    - Keep your long-term goals in mind

    - Launch early-win projects
    - Elevate change agents.

- Customers, markets, competitors, and strategy.
  - substitutes, new competitors, price war, etc
- Internal capabilities
